# Robot chef task

This report describes the development and implementation of the Robot Chef task for the Planning and Approximate Reasoning class at the FIB's Master in Artificial Intelligence.  The objective of this project is to automate meal preparation in a structured kitchen environment using a planning algorithm implemented in PDDL. For this project, we utilized the Best First Width Search (BFWS) planner to enable the robot to handle various recipes—such as tortilla, sushi, and paella — each requiring specific preparation steps across different kitchen zones. The task begins with a scenario where tools are misplaced and dirty, requiring the robot to clean, relocate, and organize the tools before proceeding with tasks like cutting, cooking, and mixing to prepare the ingredients.
