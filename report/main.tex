\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
This assignment involves designing a plan for a robot chef operating within the structured environment of a Japanese restaurant kitchen in Barcelona to autonomously handle meal preparation tasks. The robot’s objective is to receive digital orders, gather required ingredients, perform necessary preparation and cooking steps, and plate finished dishes for serving. Operating within a divided kitchen layout, the robot must navigate across specific areas for storage, preparation, cooking, serving, and dishwashing, while adhering to operational constraints such as limited carrying capacity and the need for tool sanitation after each use.

The planning solution is implemented using the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL), which defines the necessary actions, predicates, and conditions to enable the robot to effectively fulfill its tasks. This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the problem, including the structure of the PDDL model, testing cases across different scenarios, and results demonstrating the robot’s adaptability to diverse dish requirements, resource management, and task optimization. The following sections detail the problem setup, solution framework, and evaluation of scenario-based testing to assess the robot’s performance, efficiency, and flexibility.

\section{Methodologyand implementation details}
\label{sec:methodology}
We now define the predicates and actions that we are using in the PDDL implementation. The predicates define the state of the world (in this case, the kitchen and its elements), such as valid rooms and their adjacencies, the location of tools, and the condition of ingredients. Actions describe the possible operations the robot can perform, including moving around the kitchen, picking up items (tools, ingredients and dishes), and using them to assemble the required dishes.

\subsection{Predicates}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{(at ?x - portable ? - room)}: A \textit{portable} object is located in a specific room.
    \item \texttt{(clean ?tool - tool)}: The \textit{tool} is clean.
    \item \texttt{(holding ?x - item)}: The robot is holding the \textit{item}.
    \item \texttt{(not-holding)}: The robot is not holding anything. 


\end{itemize}

\subsection{Actions}

\begin{itemize}
    \item

\end{itemize}

\section{Results}
\subsection{Problem 1}
\subsubsection{Objects and Initial State}
In this problem, we have five rooms: storage-room preparation-room cooking-room serving-room dishwashing-room cutting-room. The tools are a knife and a spatula and, at the start, both are clean and at their respective rooms. The ingredients are rice, fish, and vegetables and the desired state would be to have a sushi dish served and every tool clean and on its place. The recipe for sushi is the following:

\textbf{Sushi}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Ingredients: rice, fish, vegetables.
    \item Conditions: rice must be cooked and fish and vegetables must be prepared.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Plan and Metrics}
To see the whole plan see annex \ref{sec:plan1}. The plan has a total of 77 actions, it is correct, and the chef robot is able to prepare the sushi dish. The metrics of the found plan, using BFS Planner, are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Nodes generated during search:} 1733
    \item \textbf{Nodes expanded during search:} 598
    \item \textbf{Plan found with cost:} 92
    \item \textbf{BFS search completed in:} 0.011774 seconds
\end{itemize}



\subsection{Problem 2}
\subsubsection{Objects and Initial State}
In this problem, we use the same rooms and tools as in the other problems. On the other hand, the dishes required are paella and sushi, not just sushi. In the initial state we now present two different recepies with their respective ingredients and conditions.

 \textbf{Paella}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Ingredients: rice, vegetables, fish, shrimps.
    \item Conditions: every ingredient must be cooked.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Sushi}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Ingredients: rice, fish, vegetables.
    \item Conditions: rice must be cooked and fish and vegetables must be prepared.
\end{itemize}

Besides this, at the start the knife is in the cooking room and the spatula is not clean. In this sense, the chef robot must clean the spatula before using it and move the knife to the cutting room.
\subsubsection{Plan and Metrics}
To tee the whole plan see annex \ref{sec:plan2}. The plan has a total of 179 actions, it is correct, and the chef robot is able to prepare the two dishes. The metrics of the found plan, using BFS Planner, are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Nodes generated during search:} 4289
    \item \textbf{Nodes expanded during search:} 1382
    \item \textbf{Plan found with cost:} 179
    \item \textbf{BFS search completed in:} 0.051842 seconds
\end{itemize}
