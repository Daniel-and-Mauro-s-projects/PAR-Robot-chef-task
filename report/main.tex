\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:methodology}
Describe the methods and techniques used in the project.

\section{Implementation}
\label{sec:implementation}
Detail the implementation process, including the predicates and actions we used. 

\section{Results}
\subsection{Problem 1}
\subsubsection{Objects and Initial State}
In this problem, we have five rooms: storage-room preparation-room cooking-room serving-room dishwashing-room cutting-room. The tools are a knife and a spatula and, at the start, both are clean and at their respective rooms. The ingredients are rice, fish, and vegetables and the desired state would be to have a sushi dish served and every tool clean and on its place. The recipe for sushi is the following:

\textbf{Sushi}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Ingredients: rice, fish, vegetables.
    \item Conditions: rice must be cooked and fish and vegetables must be prepared.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Plan and Metrics}
To see the whole plan see annex \ref{sec:plan1}. The plan has a total of 77 actions, it is correct, and the chef robot is able to prepare the sushi dish. The metrics of the found plan, using BFS Planner, are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Nodes generated during search:} 1733
    \item \textbf{Nodes expanded during search:} 598
    \item \textbf{Plan found with cost:} 92
    \item \textbf{BFS search completed in:} 0.011774 seconds
\end{itemize}



\subsection{Problem 2}
\subsubsection{Objects and Initial State}
In this problem, we use the same rooms and tools as in the other problems. On the other hand, the dishes required are paella and sushi, not just sushi. In the initial state we now present two different recepies with their respective ingredients and conditions.

 \textbf{Paella}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Ingredients: rice, vegetables, fish, shrimps.
    \item Conditions: every ingredient must be cooked.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Sushi}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Ingredients: rice, fish, vegetables.
    \item Conditions: rice must be cooked and fish and vegetables must be prepared.
\end{itemize}

Besides this, at the start the knife is in the cooking room and the spatula is not clean. In this sense, the chef robot must clean the spatula before using it and move the knife to the cutting room.
\subsubsection{Plan and Metrics}
To tee the whole plan see annex \ref{sec:plan2}. The plan has a total of 179 actions, it is correct, and the chef robot is able to prepare the two dishes. The metrics of the found plan, using BFS Planner, are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Nodes generated during search:} 4289
    \item \textbf{Nodes expanded during search:} 1382
    \item \textbf{Plan found with cost:} 179
    \item \textbf{BFS search completed in:} 0.051842 seconds
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Problem 3}
\subsubsection{Objects and Initial State}
In this problem, we now have three recipes to prepare: tortilla, sushi, and paella. The recipes for sushi and paella remain the same as before, but we have added the tortilla, which requires specific ingredients: eggs, potatoes, and onions.


\textbf{Tortilla}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Ingredients: eggs, potatoes, onions.
    \item Conditions: potatoes and onions must be cut first and then cooked.
\end{itemize}

The objective of this test is to evaluate what happens when there are multiple recipes and everything is out of place. The robot starts in the dishwashing room, and both tools—the spatula and the knife—are dirty and located in the wrong room (the service room).

\subsubsection{Plan and Metrics}
To tee the whole plan see annex \ref{sec:plan3}. The plan has a total of 103 actions, it is correct, and the chef robot is able to prepare the three dishes. The metrics of the found plan, using BFS Planner, are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Nodes generated during search:} 45145
    \item \textbf{Nodes expanded during search:} 14424
    \item \textbf{Plan found with cost:} 283
    \item \textbf{BFS search completed in:} 0.748445 secs
\end{itemize}
